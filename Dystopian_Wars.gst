      <description>Each functioning Storm Generator has a Value listed in parenthesis that represents the Storm Points available to each Model in a Squadron. Any Storm Points generated from various Squadron members are added together to form a total for the Squadron. Storm Points may be used in one of two ways, transforming the Generator’s purpose from defensive to area denial with one flick of a switch. These two modes are known, respectively, as Cloud Effect and Storm Effect. These effects are not mutually exclusive, and a functional Storm Generator may use both, provided the Squadron has sufficient Storm Points available.

Cloud Effect - A Model with a functioning Storm Generator is considered to have a functioning Cloud Generator (see above) with IMMEDIATE effect. Each Cloud Effect costs ONE Storm Point to maintain. A Model may only ever place a Cloud Effect upon itself, never on other Models.

Storm Effect - A Model with a functioning Storm Generator may spend Storm Points to place a number of Storm Templates, represented by the Large Effect Template on the Tabletop. Each Storm Template costs TWO Storm Points to maintain and may be placed anywhere on the Tabletop within the Range” listed in parenthesis.

If a Squadron for any reason does not have sufficient Storm Points to maintain a Storm Template,
the Template must be removed immediately. If a Squadron maintains multiple Storm Templates the
controlling player may decide which Templates should be removed. Multiple Storm Template placed by a Squadron must be placed touching, but not overlapping. Storm Templates may never overlap under any circumstances but the effects of multiple Templates are cumulative.

The effect of Storm Templates are as follows:
• All Surface and Aerial Models that touch a Storm Template at any point during their Movement Segment suffer a -1” Movement Penalty.
• All Attack Dice from Surface and Aerial Models firing into, through or out of a Storm Template, suffer a -1 ‘To Hit’ modifier.

The effect of this Generator (be it Cloud Effects or Storm Effects) lasts until the Compulsory Actions
Segment of the End Phase of the current Turn, at which time Storm Templates are removed and all Effects dissipate.</description>
