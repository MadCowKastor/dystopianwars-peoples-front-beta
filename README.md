##Overview##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]


__Still to Finish__

So Dystopian Wars is now owned by Warcradle and their 3rd edition is looking like shit so this is for the continuation of 2.5 with the People's Front ORBATS, Included will be their Release ORBATS designated with -RL at the end, their Playtest ORBATS with -PL at the end, and their Experimental ORBATS with -EX at the end.

There are 2 fleet lists that haven't recieved People's Front of Antartica updates they are designated by -SG at the end due to being the last offical release from Spartan Games

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

You will have to download manually the .bsi file until this repo is added to the Appspot data listing
